# Traffic Analysis using IBM Data Science Desktop and PixieDust
> This code pattern was tested using [DSX Desktop](https://www.ibm.com/products/data-science-experience), a lightweight version of DSX Local intended for standalone use and optimized for local development. For production deployments it is recommended to use DSX Local with a three node configuration, for information on how to do that, see the [DSX Install Docs](https://content-dsxlocal.mybluemix.net/docs/content/local/welcome.html).

In this Code Pattern we will use PixieDust running on IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) Desktop to analyze traffic data from the City of San Francisco. IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) Desktop is a free client for data scientists and data engineers which provides tools (Juyter, Notebooks, RStudio, Spark, etc.) to analyze and gather insight from their data. 

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Install [IBM Data Science Experience Desktop](https://content-dsxdesktop.mybluemix.net/docs/content/desktop/overview.html)
* Use [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) to load, visualize, and analyze data
* Run Notebooks in [IBM DSX Desktop](https://dataplatform.ibm.com/)
* Leverage [PixieDust](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/pixiedust) as a python notebook helper
* Build a dashboard using [PixieApps](https://ibm-watson-data-lab.github.io/pixiedust/pixieapps.html)
* Fetch data from [City of San Francisco Open Data](https://datasf.org/opendata/)
* Create an interactive map with [Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/)

The intended audience for this Code Pattern is application developers and other stakeholders who wish to utilize the power of Data Science quickly and effectively.

# Pre-requisites

You need to install these locally to run IBM DSX desktop projects.

1. [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)
2. [Python 2.7 and higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
3. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
4. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

# Steps

Follow these steps to setup and run this Code Pattern. The steps are
described in detail below.

1. [Download and install IBM Data Science Experience Desktop](#1-download-and-install-ibm-data-science-experience-desktop)
2. [Create a project](#2-create-a-project)
3. [Create the notebook](#3-create-the-notebook)
4. [Run the notebook](#4-run-the-notebook)
5. [Analyze the results](#5-analyze-the-results)
6. [Save and share](#6-save-and-share)

## 1. Download and Install IBM Data Science Experience Desktop

Sign up for IBM's [Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/). You can use the same login to download [IBM DSX Desktop](https://www.ibm.com/products/data-science-experience).

Once you download and launch the installer, you will be asked to choose between different packages to install for Jupyter Notebook and optional RStudio. You can follow these [installation instructions](https://content-dsxdesktop.mybluemix.net/) for IBM DSX Desktop.

## 2. Create a project

When the installation is done, the app launches and you will see sample projects and notebooks which you can start testing the app with. 

* Create a new Project by clicking the `+ new Project`.
![](doc/source/images/ibm-dsx-create-project.png)

* Add project name and description, and click `Create` button to complete project creation.
![](doc/source/images/ibm-dsx-create-project-1.png) 

## 3. Create the notebook

* After you create the project in IBM DSX Desktop, create a notebook by clicking the `+` from the top right and selecting `create notebook` option.

![](doc/source/images/ibm-dsx-create-notebook.png)

* Select the `From File` tab.
![](doc/source/images/ibm-dsx-create-notebook-1.png)

* Enter a name for the notebook.
* Optionally, enter a description for the notebook.
* Choose the following notebook part of the repostory:  [SF-Traffic-Analysis.ipynb](notebooks/SF-Traffic-Analysis.ipynb).
* Click `Create` to finish creating the notebook. 

## 4. Run the notebook

When a notebook is executed, what is actually happening is that each code cell in
the notebook is executed, in order, from top to bottom.

Each code cell is selectable and is preceded by a tag in the left margin. The tag
format is `In [x]:`. Depending on the state of the notebook, the `x` can be:

* A blank, this indicates that the cell has never been executed.
* A number, this number represents the relative order this code step was executed.
* A `*`, this indicates that the cell is currently executing.

There are several ways to execute the code cells in your notebook:

* One cell at a time.
  * Select the cell, and then press the `Run Cells` button in the toolbar.
* Batch mode, in sequential order.
  * From the `Cell` menu bar, there are several options available. For example, you
    can `Run All` cells in your notebook, or you can `Run All Below`, that will
    start executing from the first cell under the currently selected cell, and then
    continue executing all cells that follow.


## 5. Analyze the results

After running each cell of the notebook, the results will display. When we use PixieDust ``display()`` to create an interactive dataset, we are able to change the visualization using tables, graphs, and charts.

### Options for PixieDust Charts

After running cell #3 `display(incidents)`, we can see by clicking the `Options` button that we are able to manipulate the keys and values for the fields used in the chart:

![](doc/source/images/pixieDustChartOptions.png)

Following the instructions, we use PdDistrict and IncidntNum, but the user can change the keys and value to see how the chart will look with different inputs. Output of this chart options is shown below:

![](doc/source/images/pixieDustChartOptionsOutput.png)

### Use Spark SQL to query data

We use Spark SQL to isolate data to the Mission district:

```
accidents.registerTempTable("incidents")
mission = sqlContext.sql("SELECT * FROM incidents WHERE PdDistrict='MISSION'")
```

We then get an interactive map of the Mission district using command `dispaly(mission)`. You can also change options as you need using the `options` button.

![](doc/source/images/missionDistrictSQLResults.png)

> Note: The notebook uses mapBox to render map of San Fransisco. There are options to choose if you prefer google maps. In order to render the map make sure to get the `API_KEY` or `Access Token` from respective provider. The place to put the `API_KEY` or `Access Token` is by clicking ``options`` button.

![](doc/source/images/mapbox-access-token.png)


### Create a PixieApp Dashboard

With PixieApps, we can create a dashboard with map layers that can be used to visualize various datasets (i.e. Traffic Calming, Police Districts, and Crimes):

![](doc/source/images/pixieAppsLayers.png)

#### Create the skeleton

```
from pixiedust.display.app import *

@PixieApp
class SFDashboard():
    def mainScreen(self):
        return """
<div class="well">
    <center><span style="font-size:x-large">Analyzing San Francisco Public Safety data with PixieDust</span></center>
    <center><span style="font-size:large"><a href="https://datasf.org/opendata" target="new">https://datasf.org/opendata</a></span></center>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="form-group col-sm-2" style="padding-right:10px;">
        <div><strong>Layers</strong></div>
        {% for layer in this.layers %}
        <div class="rendererOpt checkbox checkbox-primary">
            <input type="checkbox" pd_refresh="map{{prefix}}" pd_script="self.toggleLayer({{loop.index0}})">
            <label>{{layer["name"]}}</label>
        </div>
        {%endfor%}
    </div>
    <div class="form-group col-sm-10">
        <div id="map{{prefix}}" pd_entity pd_options="{{this.formatOptions(this.mapJSONOptions)}}"/>
    </div>
</div>
"""
```

#### Create the Map of Incidents

```
<div id="map{{prefix}}" pd_entity pd_options="{{this.formatOptions(this.mapJSONOptions)}}"/>
```

``pd_entity``: Tell PixieDust which dataset to work on.

``pd_options``: Contains the PixieDust options for the map.

#### Generate the pd_options

The best way to generate the ``pd_options`` for a PixieDust visualization is to:

1. Call ``display()`` on a new cell
2.  Graphically select the options for your chart
3.  Select ``View/Cell Toobar/Edit metadata`` menu
4.  Click on the ``Edit Metadata`` button and copy the PixieDust metadata

![](doc/source/images/pdEditMetadata.png)

To conform to the ``pd_options`` notation, we need to transform the PixieDust JSON metadata into an attribute string with the following format: ```“key1=value1;key2=value2;…”```

To make it easier, we use a simple Python transform function:
```
def formatOptions(self, options):
    return ';'.join(["{}={}".format(k,v) for (k, v) in iteritems(options)])
```

The ``formatOptions`` is then invoked using JinJa2 notation from within the html:

```
pd_options = “{{this.formatOptions(this.mapJSONOptions)}}”
```

#### Initialize the pd_options

> Note: setup is a special method that will be called automatically when the PixieApp is initialized.

```
def setup(self):
    self.mapJSONOptions = {
      	"mapboxtoken": "<Use the map box token here>",
      	"chartsize": "90",
	"aggregation": "SUM",
	"rowCount": "500",
	"handlerId": "mapView",
	"rendererId": "mapbox",
	"valueFields": "IncidntNum",
	"keyFields": "X,Y",
	"basemap": "light-v9"
    }
```

#### Create the GeoJSON Custom Layers

```
from pixiedust.display.app import *
from pixiedust.apps.mapboxBase import MapboxBase

@PixieApp
class SFDashboard(MapboxBase):
    def setup(self):

    ...<snip>...

    self.setLayers([
        {
            "name": "Traffic calming",
            "url": "https://data.sfgov.org/api/geospatial/ddye-rism?method=export&format=GeoJSON",
            "type": "symbol",
            "layout": {
                "icon-image": "police-15",
                "icon-size": 1.5
            }
        },

    ...<snip>...
```

#### Create the Checkboxes from the Layers

```
    ...<snip>...

    {% for layer in this.layers %}
    <div class="rendererOpt checkbox checkbox-primary">
        <input type="checkbox" pd_refresh="map{{prefix}}" pd_script="self.toggleLayer({{loop.index0}})">
        <label>{{layer["name"]}}</label>
    </div>
    {%endfor%}

    ...<snip>...
```
The user can now select layers and the map will dynamically add or remove them.


## 6. Save and Share


### How to save your work:

Under the `File` menu, there are several ways to save your notebook:

* `Save` will simply save the current state of your notebook, without any version
  information.
* `Make a copy` will make a copy of your notebook.
* `Download as` will download the notebook in different file formats such as `.ipynb`, `.py`, `.html`, `.json`,`.md`,`.rst`

### How to share your work:

You can publish your notebook by selecting the cloud icon button located in the top menu bar. You need anaconda cloud username and password to share your notebook to `anaconda.org`.
